                    <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>Dark Matter are an American rock band formed in New York in 2016. The group consisted of guitarist Jack Macco, singer Emilie Bienne, bassist and keyboardist Ed Brandt, and drummer Anthony Albano. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including blues, psychedelia, and folk music.
After changing their name from E Vex, Dark Matter signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom. Although the group was initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with the debut album as Dark Matter.
  Macco wrote most of Dark Matter's music, particularly early in their career, while Bienne generally supplied the lyrics. Brandts' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's catalogue, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remain commercially and critically successful, their output and touring schedule were limited during early 2017. In the months that followed, the members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off reunions. </p>
